## Setup

1. Create a new virtual environment
2. Install other requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Add data files to `/data/...` (<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Bxcp7AepA0WYMYJPcHPyx1_qM6JBlRrj>)

## Run

To see the dashboard, run this command from your command prompt:

`bokeh serve --show main.py`

Note: Your directory should be in the Dashboard folder.

## Git Workflow

Trunk based development: New features are developed on short-lived feature branches that are merged into the main branch frequently. Feature branches should not exist longer than one week before being merged into the main branch.

Example of implementing a new feature:

1. Create new branch with descriptive name (e.g. 'implement-mse-lossfunction')
2. Implement the feature, commit frequently with descriptive commit messages.
3. When implementation is finished:
    - Merge main branch into feature branch to bring it up to the current state of development.
    - Create pull request, assign other team members.
    - Wait for pull request to be confirmed.
    - Merge feature branch into main branch.
    - Delete feature branch.
